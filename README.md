This is a Weather forecasting weather platform where users can see real-time weather updates from their current location to overseas cities by searching. We used Next.js for building this website. We are happy to share some of our features bellow-

- This is a single-paged Next.js project where clients can see their desired locations and weather updates. They can see not only the weather by their current location but also search by city name.

- On this website, we implement a map, so after searching for a city in the search box, they can see the map of that location in the map.

- Users can see five-day forecasts, 3-hour daily forecast weather cards, charts, maps, and weather alerts. Weather alerts tell customers to stay inside if the weather is too severe for people to withstand.

- There are articles and a blog section for giving users knowledge about articles, a news section for the latest news, and also a community page where all the users of this website can communicate with each other. They can express their feelings to each other. We also have a donation system which runs by a sslcommerz payment system. The money we spent on the disaster affected people.

- Firebase authentication was used for user safety. Users can create an account with an email & and password. They can also log in with Google and GitHub.
